There are Major Problems with JUNIORS CLUB such as:
	~The opening scene is cutted from latest videos which is important for a kids channel. There should be a opening for 20-30 seconds with goofy and funny sound effects.
	~The number of tags, type of tags, metadata, description, title and thumbnail difference may be the result of lower engagement and monetization.
	~ Since this channel is not limited to a single niche you can combine English, Urdu, Art, Maths, GK and many more subjects to it as well.
	~The written and learning part can be added together but there is serious lack of activity and Q&A. More activities should be added.
	~Repeatition of the same content has further damaged the monetization process. New content should be placed before re-using them.
	~The voice actors need to be replaced. Their voice is not engaging and seems odd. If you cannot then increase the voice quality to an agree-able standard.
	~Establish a mascot for the channel and avoid changing voice actors again and again. This leads to unfamiliarity with kids that damages their engagement.
	~The sudden changing of art-style and use of less brighter colors may have been one of the reason why the channel lost so much engagement.
	~The content has good music but it doesn't blends well with narration. The narrator should slow down a little and speak in a slow but clear-spoken voice.
	~Post weekly at maximum and daily at minimum. Also, both options are valid. Daily uploads can be used for shorts or learning like ABC phonics or simply writing while weekly can be used for a special activity. It depends on you and your company. 
	~You can also create an instagram account and post clips related to the content. It won't lead to crazy engagement on instagram but it is a good way to promote the channel.
	~There is no short form content. Since the videos are not longer than 6 minutes, shorts are an important way to reach monetization goal for 4000 hour watch time.
	~The time gap between the uploading, especially after the ABC phonics song could be the reason for low viewers.
	~The name is not unique and there are already three to four channels established under similar name which leads to some monetization problem.
	~Use of AI voice-overs is also not good for monetization sometimes.
	~Using and relying on AI Generated images only or even mostly is another way that can lead to potential demonetization."


VERSION 2
There are Major Problems with JUNIORS CLUB such as:
Missing Opening Scene
	~The intro is cut from recent videos, which is a big issue for a kids' channel.
	~There should be a fun, 20-30 second opening with goofy sound effects to grab attention.
Content Feels Too Limited
	~Since the channel isn’t focused on just one subject, why not add more?
	~You can include English, Urdu, Art, Math, General Knowledge, and more to make it exciting.
Not Enough Activities or Q&A
	~The learning and writing sections could be combined, but they feel a bit empty.
	~More activities and interactive Q&A would make it fun for kids.
Repeating the Same Content Too Much
Using the same videos over and over hurts monetization.
	~New content should come first before reusing older videos.
Voice Acting Feels Off
	~The voice actors don’t sound engaging and feel out of place.
If replacing them isn’t possible, at least improve the voice quality so it’s more pleasant to listen to.
No Familiar Character or Mascot
	~Kids connect better with familiar voices and characters.
	~Having a consistent mascot and sticking to the same voices will help keep engagement steady.
Art Style & Colors Keep Changing
	~The art style suddenly changes, and dull colors might be part of why engagement has dropped.
	~Stick to bright, kid-friendly visuals for a more appealing look.
Music & Narration Don’t Blend Well
	~The music is good, but it doesn’t match the narration properly.
	~The narrator should slow down and speak clearly so kids can follow along better.
Inconsistent Posting Schedule
	~Try posting at least once a week (for special activities).
	~Daily uploads can work too for shorts, ABC phonics, or writing practice would fit well.
No Instagram Presence
	~Setting up an Instagram page could help promote the channel.
It won’t bring massive engagement, but it’s a good way to bring in more viewers.
No YouTube Shorts
	~Since most videos are under 6 minutes, short-form content is a must for growth.
	~Shorts can help reach the 4,000-hour watch time needed for monetization.
Upload Gaps Are Hurting Views
	~The long break after the ABC Phonics Song could be why viewership dropped.
	~Keeping a consistent schedule will help maintain engagement.
Channel Name Isn't Unique
	~There are other channels with similar names, which makes it harder to grow.
	~This could cause monetization issues and confusion for new viewers.
AI Voice-Overs Could Be a Problem
	~YouTube sometimes flags AI-generated voices, which can hurt monetization.
	~If possible, use real voices instead.
Overusing AI-Generated Images
	~Relying too much on AI-generated images could lead to demonetization issues.
	~Mixing in original visuals would be a safer approach.
Difference in SEO may be a reason:
	~The number and type of tags,metadata given, description length and tonality, title and thumbnail difference can become a result of lower engagement and monetization.
